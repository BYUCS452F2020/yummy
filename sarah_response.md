#Response for hw assignment -- 
I am interested in this project because of my love for good recipes.
I actually don't really like to cook, most of the time I just want
to be able to find an easy recipe that I can cook within a certain
amount of time. So when Gordon came up with this idea I thought it 
was brilliant. If there's a way for me to sort what I want to make
by cook time and cooking method, then it would really help me in my 
life right now. I also really love asian recipes, and sometimes it
is sometimes really hard to find authentic ones.

I'm not sure what we will do yet, but it would be cool to be able to 
first have the recipes we want in its orignal language, then maybe
translate it later. I plan to participate by helping with recipe 
collection. I will most definitely be helping with the cook time and
cooking method part of the database (however we do it). 

I'm personally not proficient at all in handling databases. I'm computer
engineering so we don't really have to deal with this very much. 
I'm excited to learn from my peers and do whatever is necessary 
so that the work load is fairly equal for all my team members.
